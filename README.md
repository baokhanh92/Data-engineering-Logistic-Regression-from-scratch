## [ 1. OVERVIEW ]()

[ **1.1 About the data**: ]() 

- For each purpose I used different dataset:
[**1. Data engineering**](): Titanic dataset, I will predict the chance of survival of one person based on the factors such as sex, class, age...
[**2. Logistic Regression**](): cat images will be used to train a model to classify cat or not. I will write the Logistic Regression code from scratch.

[ **1.2 What you can expect in this github**: ]() 
1. Demo of how to use data engineering to better predict the outcome
2. How to build a logistic regression class

## [ 2. THE RESULT ]()

### [2.1 Data engineering]()
**- By doing some simple data enginerring, I can increase my accuracy score form 73% to about 80%. Let's check how I did that in the ipynb file.**

### [2.2 Logistic regression]()
**- A Logistic regression class = algorithms + code**
**- What we do is to learn how to code these algorithms into Python and make sure it runs in the right order.**
